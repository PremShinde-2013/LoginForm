README - Login Form using PHP
===============================

This README file provides a guide on how to use and set up a login form using PHP. The login form allows users to authenticate themselves with a username and password combination.

File Structure
--------------
- `welcome.php`: The main login form file.
- `login.php`: The file that processes the login credentials and performs authentication.
- `dbconnect.php`: Configuration file containing database connection details.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the login form.

Prerequisites
-------------
1. PHP installed on your web server.
2. A MySQL database to store user credentials.
3. Basic knowledge of PHP and HTML.

Setup Instructions
------------------
1. Clone the repository or download the files to your web server's document root.
2. Create a MySQL database and import the provided `users.sql` file to set up the `users` table.
3. Open the `dbconnect.php` file and update the database connection details with your own credentials.
4. Ensure that the `dbconnect.php` file is in the same directory as the other PHP files.
5. Customize the login form's design by modifying the `style.css` file.
6. Access the login form by visiting the `index.php` file in your web browser.

Usage
-----
1. Open the login form by accessing the `index.php` file in your web browser.
2. Enter your username and password.
